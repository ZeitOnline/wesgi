    * Capability token? (http://www.w3.org/TR/esi-lang)

Correctness
-----------

    * Everything except esi:include is unimplemented.
    * Add more policies

Production Ready
----------------

To make the code production ready we need to:

    * Implement fragment caching.
        - Cache plugin system
        - Based on Cache-Control headers
        - Create some plugins: Disk, memcache, memory?
    * HTTP connection management:
        - Cache connections to backend servers
        - Limit number of connections in a sane way

Note: "production" ready is relative, see README.txt
